# Project Development Rules

## Code Structure and Organization
1. Follow a clear and consistent directory structure
2. Use meaningful file and folder names that reflect their purpose
3. Maintain separation of concerns between different components
4. Keep related files together in appropriate modules

## Coding Standards
1. Follow consistent code formatting and style guidelines
2. Write clear, self-documenting code with meaningful variable/function names
3. Add appropriate comments for complex logic
4. Keep functions focused and single-purpose
5. Limit function length to maintain readability
6. Use proper indentation and spacing

## Version Control
1. Make frequent, small commits with clear messages

3. Keep the main branch stable and deployable
4. Review code before merging to main branch
5. Tag important releases

## Documentation
1. Maintain up-to-date README files
2. Document setup and installation procedures
3. Include API documentation where applicable
4. Document important architectural decisions
5. Keep documentation in sync with code changes

## Testing

3. Run tests before committing code
4. Fix failing tests promptly
5. Include integration and end-to-end tests

## Security
1. Follow security best practices
2. Keep dependencies updated
